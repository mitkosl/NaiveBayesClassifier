    "title": "U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA",
    "body": "The U.S. Agriculture Department \nformally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to\ndrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers\nfor the cut with targeted income payments.\n    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying\nthe \"Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987\", Peter Myers,\nDeputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration\nwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning\nwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.\n    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the\ngovernment for the price support cut with targeted income\npayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would\ncost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.\n    The administration sugar proposal is expected to be\nintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.\nJohn Porter, R-Ill.\n    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it\nis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because\npolitically-influential sugar and corn growers\nand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.\n    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration \ntargets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually\nlowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment\nany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.\n    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower\nwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3\ncts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.\n    The income payments would be based on the amount of\ncommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985\nor 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.\n    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes\nin the sugar program because the current high price support is\ncausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.\n    He said the current program has artificially stimulated\ndomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed\ncorn sweeteners to make market inroads.\n    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a\n\"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only one\nmln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar\nrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.\n    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives\noverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a\ncompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of\nsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing\nfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.\n    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on\nU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said\nconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than\nnecessary for sugar.\n    \"Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between\nsweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse\nimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently\nfacing,\" Myers said.\n    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per\nlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons\nrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to\ncompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.\n    QUANTITY            1988     1989      1990      1991\nFirst 350 tons         6.000    4.500     3.000     1.500\nOver 350 to 700        5.750    4.313     2.875     1.438\nOver 700 to 1,000      5.500    4.125     2.750     1.375\nOver 1,000 to 1,500    5.000    3.750     2.500     1.250\nOver 1,500 to 3,000    4.500    3.375     2.250     1.125\nOver 3,000 to 6,000    3.500    2.625     1.750     0.875\nOver 6,000 to 10,000   2.250    1.688     1.125     0.563\nOver 10,000 to 20,000  0.500    0.375     0.250     0.125\nOver 20,000 tons        nil      nil       nil       nil \n Reuter\n\u0003",

    "title": "STRIKE THREAT, LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING",
    "body": "The St. Lawrence Seaway, set\nto reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year\nbecause of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the\nfirst strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials\nsaid.\n    Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes\nof transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal\nincrease over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on\nthe 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.\n    In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the\nseaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal\nand Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal,\nlinking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.\n    By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled\nthrough the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through\nthe eight-lock canal.\n    The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs\nthis year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal\n1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive\nmember of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.\n    The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain.\nThose exports of the single most important commodity carried on\nthe waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.\n    The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about\n2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said\nit will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers'\ndemands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.\n    \"It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike,\" Roman\nGralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.\n    The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator\nto try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two\nsides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on\nthe Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.\n    \"We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a\nprolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,\" Seaway\nAuthority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.\n    \"These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the\nSt Lawrence Seaway,\" George Miller, vice-president of the\nCanadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major\nCanadian shipping companies, said recently.\n    The workers' current contract expires May 31. The\nassociation said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages\nfor the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to\nrestructure crew dispatching.\n    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs\n(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and\nfreight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985\nwas its worst year in two decades.\n    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on\nthe Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last\nyear's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls\nthroughout the rest of the waterway.\n    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and\nabout 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.\n    \"We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we\nwon't see a major increase for a number of years,\" Hemsley said.\n    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers\nin Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this\nseason but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,\nBlair said.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
