Bryan Sims
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices settled lower on Monday as rising U.S. output, a weaker physical market and recent dollar strength added to the pressure from a widespread decline across equities and commodities markets.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 closed down 96 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $67.62 a barrel after hitting a session low of $66.98 a barrel.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 settled down $1.30, or 1.99 percent, at $64.15.

“To me this looks like a good old fashioned get-me-out trade. It is hard for me to get real bearish in crude given that the global economy is doing well,” said Bill O‘Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, Missouri.

U.S. stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the Dow industrials .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX posting their biggest one-day percentage drop since August 2011. With Monday's declines, the S&P 500 erased its gains for 2018 and is now down 0.9 percent this year.[.N]

The sell-off in the stock market came after a monthly U.S. jobs report on Friday that showed the fastest wage growth in nearly nine years exacerbated a broader market sell-off that was already under way as European stocks backed off record highs and a rising dollar dented commodities prices.

“There was a lot of fear in the marketplace the economy is going to be too good, which was already priced in the recent oil rally, and that trickled down in the oil market,” Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.

“What’s good about this correction is that it is based on bullish economic news. I think the minute we see stocks get stability I think you’ll see oil price stability as well,” he added.

Oil, which recently hit the highest levels in nearly three years, has also been pressured by rising U.S. crude production, which could threaten the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ effort to support prices.

U.S. government data last week showed output climbed above 10 million barrels per day in November for the first time since 1970.

Analysts expected U.S. crude supplies would post a weekly rise for the second straight week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday. Industry group American Petroleum Institute posts its data on Tuesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports on Wednesday.

    "body": "Market volatility spurs some funds to look again at currency hedging

Simon Jessop, Saikat Chatterjee

LONDON (Reuters) - A pick up in currency market volatility over the last few days after years of suppression by central banks’ easy-money policies has prompted some investors to look again at protecting against, or profiting from, sharp moves.

To hedge or not is a question that divides asset managers, with some actively buying and selling currency exposure through derivatives to boost or protect returns, and others refusing to spend the money, viewing the long-term impact as neutral.

Even when they do hedge to protect earnings from overseas, many focus on bonds rather than equities, given currencies often move inversely to the more volatile stock market and the impact of adverse currency swings is bigger on fixed-income assets.

But as global central banks look to tighten policy, lowering expected market returns, the perceived risk from a currency move rises - a leading index of implied currency volatility is up by half over the past five weeks.

It can be justified: the dollar fell 10 percent in 2017 against the currencies of its main trading partners while sterling rose steadily.

These moves were relatively gradual, lacking the spikes of volatility that marked previous shifts thanks to the numbing effect of the trillions that central banks poured into financial markets after the 2008 global crisis. But the anaesthetic is being slowly withdrawn, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve which has already raised interest rates five times this cycle.

The $4 trillion wiped off global stocks from record highs only eight days ago is a timely reminder that, as Rabobank analysts noted, “one-way bets don’t exist”.

On top of this, major currency swings can make a big difference to the end-of-year returns for active fund managers invested in foreign markets as they fight to prove their skill to clients who have one eye on cheaper, index-fund alternatives.

Sterling’s 20 percent rise to a post-Brexit referendum high of $1.43 in late January, coupled with uncertainty over future moves as Britain negotiates to leave the European Union, has prompted others to act.

One is Janus Henderson’s head of multi-asset investing, Paul O‘Connor, given the increasing portion of his portfolios invested in overseas markets ranging from Japanese equities to U.S. corporate debt.

“As a result, we are running about a third to half of portfolios on a hedged basis as we have a very low conviction on where sterling is headed with many of the factors that were supportive of sterling previously starting to look a bit tired now,” O‘Connor, whose funds manage 5 billion pounds, said.

Mark Astley, CEO at Millennium Global Investors, a currency investment manager, offers a range of hedging or profit-seeking foreign exchange strategies to investors, more of whom were concerned about the impact of a large currency swing.

“We are having a lot more conversations in the last 6-9 months than we have had for a number of years before on the potential impact of a 10 percent currency move,” he said.

Such a swing would have a much bigger effect on investors’ returns if they expect their portfolios to grow by zero to five percent in the post easy-money era, rather than by 10 to 15 percent as in the recent past.

Any decision to hedge can translate into market flows of hundreds of millions of dollars in the currency forwards and swap markets most often used by investors and become a big source of strength for currencies.

RISKS

While realised volatility in foreign exchange markets has declined in recent years as a result of the central bank policies, the market has still been hit by sharp moves around unexpected macroeconomic events.

Among the biggest of recent years were the Swiss central bank’s removal of the franc’s peg to the euro in January 2015, and sterling’s plunge after the Brexit referendum.

Before the vote, many large investors had no currency hedges in place and so reaped windfall profits as the pound fell more than 15 percent, boosting the value of their overseas assets in sterling terms.

Colin Hart, a multi-asset portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said many UK pension funds and insurers were conscious they had enjoyed a good run from non-sterling market exposure and were turning a little more cautious.

“The trend is to go back towards a long-term neutral level, which should be around 65 percent hedged, and now we have got only 45 percent.”

Mercer’s annual asset allocation survey for 2017 - which covers more than 1,200 institutional investors holding more than $1.1 trillion - found that a majority hedge about 40 percent of their currency risk.

“Though most pension funds don’t pursue an active hedging strategy, in most cases, they will put in place a long-term strategic hedge ratio that doesn’t change dramatically over time,” said Phil Edwards, global director of strategic research at Mercer.

Unlike hedge funds which look to boost investment returns from currency hedges, longer-term investors such as pension funds view currency hedging as a tool to cushion the impact of foreign exchange volatility on portfolios and therefore have a longer-term ratio they work with.

More questions are also being raised by asset owners in the United States where U.S. stocks plunged on Monday, with the Dow Jones average .DJI notching up its biggest intraday decline in history with a nearly 1,600-point drop - making overseas returns even more important.

“The question we are asking U.S. investors is that you had a perfect year in 2017 from your domestic equity market returns and a weaker dollar boosting the value of your overseas assets and that can easily transform into a perfect storm,” said James Wood-Collins, CEO at Record Currency Management, which advises nearly $60 billion in currency hedging strategies to clients.

    "body": "World coffee supply seen moving to surplus on record Brazil crop: Reuters poll

Marcy Nicholson

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global coffee supplies will shift to a surplus in 2018-19 with top grower Brazil on track to harvest a record crop, but prices will rise modestly by the end of the year as countries restock inventories, a Reuters poll of 14 traders and analysts showed.

Arabica futures were forecast to rise by 6.5 percent by the end of 2018, compared with the end of 2017, while robusta is expected to climb by 4.8 percent.

The survey’s median forecast pegged global coffee supplies at a deficit of 3.15 million 60-kg bags in the 2017-18 crop year (October/September) and then moving to a surplus of 4 million bags in 2018-19.

This forecast was largely due to expectations for top grower Brazil to harvest a record crop of 60 million 60-kg bags, made up of 44 million bags of arabica and 16 million bags of robusta, the median result from the poll showed.

Estimates ranged from a total of 55 million to 65 million bags. Brazil’s government agency Conab forecast the country will grow between 54.44 million and 58.51 million bags in 2018, which would be a record.

“The ongoing de-stocking of green coffee stocks in Japan, Europe and the United States against depleted producer coffee stocks, against the inability to rebuild those stocks in 2018 to any major degree, place coffee in a very precarious situation should Mother Nature inflict any damaging conditions anywhere in the coffee-producing world,” said Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors in Florida.

Brazil’s 2019-20 crop was estimated at 54 million bags, with 39 million bags of arabica and 15 million bags of robusta.

Vietnam, the world’s biggest grower of robusta, was forecast to harvest 28.5 million bags of coffee in 2017-18, with estimates ranging from 27 million to 30 million bags.

Spot arabica coffee prices were forecast to end the first quarter of 2018 at $1.25 per lb, down 1 percent from the end of 2017. They were pegged finishing the calendar year at $1.344, up 6.5 percent from end-2017, with estimates ranging from $1 to $1.85.

“(The) market will focus on a large deficit in 2019-20 due to off-years and poor husbandry worldwide driven by low prices,” one trader said, referring to the crop’s natural cycle to produce smaller amounts every second year.

Second-position robusta coffee futures were seen ending the first quarter at $1,750 per tonne and the year at $1,800, up from end-2017 at $1,718.

    "body": "How alcohol damages stem cell DNA and increases cancer risk

Kate Kelland

LONDON (Reuters) - Drinking alcohol produces a harmful chemical in the body which can lead to permanent genetic damage in the DNA of stem cells, increasing the risk of cancer developing, according to research published on Wednesday.

Working with mice in a laboratory, British scientists used chromosome analysis and DNA sequencing to examine the genetic damage caused by acetaldehyde, a harmful chemical produced when the body processes alcohol.

Their findings offered more detail about how alcohol increases the risk of developing 7 types of cancer, including common forms such as breast and bowel cancer. It also showed how the body seeks to defend against the damage alcohol can do.

“Some cancers develop due to DNA damage in stem cells. While some damage occurs by chance, our findings suggest that drinking alcohol can increase the risk of this damage,” said Ketan Patel, a professor at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, who co-led the study.

The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, citing “convincing evidence” it causes cancer in humans.

A study published in 2011 found that alcohol is responsible for around 4 percent of all cancer in Britain - equating to around 12,800 cases a year.

In Wednesday’s study, published in the journal Nature, Patel’s team gave diluted alcohol to mice and then analyzed the effect on the animals’ DNA. They found that acetaldehyde can break and damage DNA within blood stem cells, permanently altering the DNA sequences within these cells.

This is important, Patel said, because when healthy stem cells become faulty, they can give rise to cancerous cells.

The researchers also looked at how the body tries to protect itself against damage caused by alcohol. The first line of defense is a group of enzymes called aldehyde dehydrogenases or ALDHs, Patel explained. These break down the acetaldehyde into acetate, which cells can then use as a source of energy.

In the study, when mice lacking a critical ALDH enzyme were given alcohol, their DNA suffered four times as damage compared with mice with a properly functioning version of the enzyme.

Patel said cells also have a second line of defense in the form of a range of DNA repair systems which, most of the time, allow them to fix and reverse different types of DNA damage.

But in some instances and in some people - particularly people from South East Asia - the repair systems fail to work, meaning their cells are unable to repair effectively.

“It’s important to remember that alcohol clearance and DNA repair systems are not perfect, and alcohol can still cause cancer in different ways - even in people whose defense mechanisms are intact,” Patel said.

    "body": "France's Macron confronts Corsica's calls for more autonomy

Paul Ortoli

AJACCIO, France (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron traveled to Corsica on Tuesday to confront demands for greater autonomy for the restive Mediterranean island by nationalists buoyed by unprecedented political strength.

French President Emmanuel Macron greets Claude Erignac's widow Dominique Erignac as French Senate speaker Gerard Larcher looks on during a ceremony in tribute to the slain French prefect Claude Erignac in Ajaccio, on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, France, February 6, 2018 as part of his two-day visit in Corsica.

Macron paid homage to Claude Erignac, the island’s prefect who was shot dead by separatists in Ajaccio two decades ago, and will later meet nationalist leaders before setting out his vision for Corsica in a speech on Wednesday.

Corsica’s relationship with mainland France has long troubled French presidents. Separatists waged a 40-year militant campaign, blowing up police stations and mansions owned by mainlanders and carrying out assassinations, before laying down arms in 2014.

Since then, the same dissatisfaction with mainstream parties that has spurred secessionist ambitions elsewhere in Europe, such as Catalonia, has bolstered the nationalists’ political support. In December, the two-party “Pe a Corsica” (For Corsica) nationalist alliance won nearly two-thirds of seats in the regional assembly.

Its leaders demand a special status for Corsica in the constitution and greater autonomy, as well as equal status for the French and Corsican languages and amnesty for Corsicans jailed for pro-independence violence.

Macron has said he is open to some changes but has ruled out recognizing Corsican alongside French, and on Tuesday reiterated his refusal to pardon Corsican militants.

“Corsica, a proud and dignified land, was dirtied by this crime,” Macron, on his first visit to the island, said in reference to the 1998 shooting of Erignac.

“Justice was delivered and will be followed, without complacency, without forgetting, without amnesty.”

BALACLAVAS TO POLITICS

Unlike Spain and Germany, France has been reluctant to devolve much power to its regions, despite some decentralization in the 1980s.

Corsica’s nationalists are themselves divided over whether their ambition should be enhanced autonomy or independence.

Corsica’s tiny 8.6-billion-euro economy is propped up by central government financing and local tax breaks, and lacks the clout of Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of the Spanish economy, or Scotland, which enjoys substantial devolved authority while remaining within the United Kingdom.

Some parallels might be drawn with Wales where a devolution of powers from London in the late 1990s led to more autonomy over housing, education and health, as well as a recovery in the number of people learning and speaking Welsh. Support for outright independence, however, remains low.

Within the Pe a Corsica alliance, the moderately autonomist Femu a Corsica party holds power in numbers over the committed Separatist Corsica Libera party. Even so, Femu politician Gilles Simeoni, who heads the regional executive, last week told Reuters that Macron risked violence if he did not take talks seriously.

“In the 1980s and 1990s, when the nationalist movement only represented a minority and was violent, governments of the left and right held talks with men in balaclavas,” he said in the interview. “But today, when we represent a majority and say there is no other path than democracy, the government does not want to budge on anything.”
