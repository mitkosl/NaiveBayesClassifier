LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to its lowest levels in more than three years against a basket of currencies on Friday, headed for its biggest weekly loss in two years as negative sentiment offset any support the greenback could take from rising Treasury yields.

The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back easy monetary policy.

Traders’ confidence in the dollar has also been eroded by mounting worries over the United States’ twin budget and current account deficits, with the latter projected to balloon to near $1 trillion in 2019 amid a government spending splurge and hefty corporate tax cuts.

Extending the previous day’s losses, the dollar’s index against a group of six major currencies fell to 88.253 , the lowest since December 2014. The index was on track to lose around 2 percent on the week in its largest decline since February 2016.

Those falls have come as U.S. Treasury yields have hit four-year highs, with U.S. inflation coming in stronger than expected in January, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve could increase interest rates as many as four times this year.

That has left many analysts puzzled, as higher Treasury yields are normally associated with a stronger dollar.

Chris Turner, head of currency strategy at ING in London, said the breakdown of the traditional relationship between U.S. Treasuries and the dollar, particularly against the yen, could be explained by the fact that yields are rising on the back of worries over the budget deficit rather than inflation.

“This year’s rise in Treasury yields has been driven more by the term premium - that’s a risk premium investors require for holding long-term debt,” Turner said. “International investors are requiring a concession in the dollar to hold U.S. assets because of the fiscal risk.”

“Also, the U.S. Treasury is happy to talk fast and loose about the dollar, which I‘m sure hasn’t gone unnoticed by investors and other central bankers,” Turner added.

The dollar slipped to as low as 105.545 yen in Asian trading, its weakest in 15 months. It was on track for a weekly loss of almost 3 percent.

The reappointment of Haruhiko Kuroda as Bank of Japan governor and the nomination of BOJ executive director Masayoshi Amamiya and Waseda University professor Masazumi Wakatabe as deputy governors had little impact on the yen, although the proposed leadership trio were seen certain to keep the central bank on an ultra-loose policy path.

The euro climbed to a three-year top of $1.2556 and was poised to gain 2.4 percent this week.

The Swiss franc reached 0.9190 franc per dollar, its strongest since June 2015.

“It’s difficult for the market to see the dollar rebounding, especially as decent U.S. fundamentals seem to be providing no support for the currency,” said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.

    "title": "BHP Billiton to drill two new deepwater wells in Trion this year",
    "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Drilling of a new appraisal well and a separate exploration well in BHP Billiton deepwater Trion project will begin later this year, part of a plan approved by Mexican regulators on Thursday that also revised downward the project’s estimated oil and gas resources.

Australian mining and oil giant BHP Billiton won the rights to operate Trion in late 2016, taking a 60 percent stake in the project valued at some $11 billion, while Mexico’s state-owned oil company Pemex [PEMX.UL] holds the remaining 40 percent.

The project marked the first-ever deepwater joint venture partnership for Mexico’s newly opened oil sector following a constitutional energy overhaul in 2013.

Drilling for the new exploration well is scheduled to begin in October, part of BHP Billiton’s obligations under the 35-year license contract it signed with the Mexican government.

The four-year exploration plan sets out three potential well locations, all west of the two original Trion wells previously drilled by Pemex in 2012 and 2014 and at different depths.

The plan also calls for the operator to drill a separate appraisal well in the part of Trion discovered by Pemex, which a company official speaking on background said will begin between August and October.

The Trion block, some 8,430 feet (2,570 meters) below sea level, lies just south of the U.S.-Mexico maritime border in the Gulf of Mexico’s Perdido Fold Belt.

The exploration plan also calls for a range of geological studies as well as the acquisition and processing of new three-dimensional seismic data.

Pemex had previously estimated that the area contains reserves of 485 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), but BHP’s exploration plans reclassified the estimated resource.

The company’s new estimate puts Trion’s “contingent resources” at 475 million boe.

Gaspar Franco, one of the commissioners of the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) that supervises the contracts, said during a session of the governing body of Mexico’s oil regulator on Thursday that such reassessments are welcome.

“(Trion‘s) new operator has come along and said, ‘Excuse me, but for me these still aren’t reserves. Let me do the necessary studies,'” said Franco.

“This operator is coming with its investment and its taking the risk,” he added.

Pemex will not have to contribute funding for the project for at least the first three years.

The CNH’s governing body voted unanimously to approve the exploration plan.

    "title": "Lost in translation? GM plant shutdown shocks South Korea",
    "body": "Hyunjoo Jin, Ju-min Park, Cynthia Kim

SEOUL (Reuters) - Only weeks into a new job heading General Motors Co’s international operations, Barry Engle flew into a frigid South Korea in January and held a series of meetings with government officials to discuss the future of GM’s loss-making local unit.

In what they thought were meet-and-greet introductions, senior officials agreed to work with the global automaker on problems at GM Korea, according to South Korean officials with direct knowledge of the meetings.

Last week, Engle made another visit, meeting with the head of state-run Korea Development Bank, which owns 17 percent of GM Korea. Bank and government officials said Engle asked for financial support and in return, KDB suggested an audit before it would consider committing any fresh funding.

South Korea officials said they left reassured they were making progress working through issues, albeit slowly.

Then came the bombshell.

On Tuesday morning, GM announced it would shut its Gunsan plant, which employs 2,000, and decide the future of the remaining three other Korean plants within weeks.

“GM only talked about the difficult situation they were in, and asked for our help, but did not say a word about the closure before. It was a shock to us,” a South Korean government official said.

The discord and lack of communications point to rocky negotiations ahead as South Korea seeks to prevent further job losses and provide support for a critical part of its manufacturing sector while avoiding criticism for spending tax payers’ money to support private industry.

The tensions also come at a difficult time for U.S.-South Korean relations given U.S. President Donald Trump’s determination to renegotiate the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Any undermining of the Seoul-Washington relationship could also factor against efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.

“DEEPLY ROOTED DISTRUST”

The government official and another source said GM informed Seoul about the decision in a phone call only the evening before its announcement.

The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitive ongoing nature of the matter.

A GM Korea spokesman confirmed the company notified the government about Gunsan closure on Monday, but said the matter had been already discussed and approved by the board, including board members nominated by KDB, last week.

“We plan to seek full support from government and other stakeholders about our turnaround plan,” he said.

KDB declined to comment.

South Korea’s government said it deeply regretted GM’s unilateral decision and any aid would depend on GM’s new investment into its Korean operations.

GM said it will invest if it is successful in “working with our stakeholders to restructure and get to a viable cost structure”.

“There is deep rooted distrust about GM among government officials. Trust has collapsed a long time ago,” a person familiar with the South Korean government’s thinking said.

KDB believes GM Korea has not shared sufficient information about its finances or the cause of its mounting losses, this person added.

The GM Korea spokesman said it will explain its “transparent practice” to the government during upcoming discussions.",
